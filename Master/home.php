		For many people Yoga is thought of as a class you go to that lasts an hour, or an hour and a half, in which you perform postures (asanas). It is supposed to make you feel relaxed, happier, stronger, healthier and more flexible.
		And yes that is all part of it, but yoga is also so much more than just that........
		Yoga is not about already having a capable and flexible body to do complicated postures. This belief keeps many people from trying yoga out, which is a shame because yoga is really for everyone.

		<h2>Remember, your body is not there to serve to pose. Poses are there to serve the body.</h2>
